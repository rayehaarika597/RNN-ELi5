# RNN Explained to a 5-year-old 

Alright, imagine you have a super-smart robot friend named RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). RNN is like a clever storyteller in the world of computers. What makes RNN special is that it has a fantastic memory – it can remember important things from the past, like parts of a story.

Now, RNNs aren't new; they've been around since the 1980s. But it's like they just got their superhero powers recently. Why? Well, our computers got a lot stronger, we have tons of data to play with, and there's this cool thing called long short-term memory (LSTM) that was invented in the 1990s, making RNNs even better.

RNNs are like brainy detectives that can predict what happens next in a sequence of events. They're excellent for things like time series, speech, text, money stuff, videos, and more. Basically, if there's a sequence of data where the order matters, RNNs are the go-to heroes.

Imagine you're talking to Siri or using Google Translate – the magic behind them often involves RNNs. It's like having a really smart friend who understands the flow of words and can predict what you'll say or translate it into another language.

So, in simple terms, RNNs are like memory wizards in the computer world. They're awesome at understanding sequences, making them the go-to heroes for all sorts of cool tasks in our everyday lives!


## How Do Recurrent Neural Networks Work?

Imagine you have two kinds of smart robots: Feed-Forward Robot and Recurrent Robot. These robots are like computer brains that can learn stuff. Now, let's dive into how they work.

**Feed-Forward Robot:**
Think of Feed-Forward Robot as a one-way street. It gets information, thinks about it, and gives you an answer. It's like reading a book from start to finish – it doesn't remember the past pages, and it's not great at predicting what happens next. Imagine telling it the word "neuron" letter by letter. By the time it hears "r," it forgets about "n," "e," and "u" – not so good at guessing the next letter.

**Recurrent Robot:**
Now, meet Recurrent Robot. It's like a magician with a loop-de-loop. When it decides something, it thinks about the current info and what it learned before. Imagine you say "neuron," and it not only knows about "r" but remembers the whole word because of its cool memory loop. It's like adding the recent past to the present – that's its trick!

**Why Recurrent Robots are Special:**
RNNs, our Recurrent Robots, are awesome for sequences, like when you have data that follows a certain order, like time. They can remember stuff, making them great for predicting what comes next. If you think about it like telling a story, RNNs are the storytellers who remember every plot twist and character.

**Long-Term Memory (LSTM):**
Some Recurrent Robots even have a long-term memory, like a superpower. It helps them remember things for a really, really long time. So, not only do they remember what happened recently, but they also recall important stuff from ages ago!

In a nutshell, Recurrent Neural Networks are like super-smart robots that shine in understanding sequences. They're the memory magicians of the computer world, remembering past events and predicting the future – like having a robot friend who never forgets a good story!


## Types of Recurrent Neural Networks

Alright, let's explore the different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using a fun analogy about robot friends:

**1. One to One (O2O):**
Imagine you have a robot friend named O2O. This robot is like a solo artist, singing one song at a time. You give it one input, and it gives you one output. It's like having a conversation with a friend – you say something, and they respond.

**2. One to Many (O2M):**
Now, meet O2M, the multitasking robot. This one is like a musician playing a melody in response to a single note. You give it one input, and it creates a whole sequence of outputs. It's like saying one word, and O2M turns it into a song or a story. It's great at expanding on a single idea.

**3. Many to One (M2O):**
Next up is M2O, the robot that loves group activities. Imagine you and your friends telling M2O a bunch of stories. M2O takes all those inputs and gives you one combined output. It's like a team effort where everyone contributes, and M2O synthesizes it into something meaningful.

**4. Many to Many (M2M):**
Lastly, there's M2M, the ultimate collaboration robot. In this scenario, you and your friends talk, and M2M responds with a sequence. It's like having a back-and-forth conversation where both you and M2M contribute multiple inputs and outputs. It's fantastic for dynamic interactions.

These RNN types are like different modes of communication for your robot friends – some like chatting one-on-one, others enjoy turning a single idea into a creative output, and some thrive in group conversations. Each type has its own special way of handling sequences, making them versatile for various tasks in the world of computing.


## Backpropagation Through Time


Let's dive into this like we're exploring a robot training camp!

**1. Backpropagation (BP):**
Imagine you have a squad of robots in training. Each robot is like a tiny brain trying to learn something new. Backpropagation is like the coach guiding them. The coach checks how well they're doing, figures out where they made mistakes, and then gives them specific instructions to get better. It's like correcting your friends when they're learning a new game – you tell them what went wrong so they can improve.

**2. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):**
Now, let's introduce BPTT. Think of your robot friends as a relay team passing a baton. BPTT is like a coach guiding them not just in the current lap but through all the laps they've run. It's saying, "Hey, not only did you stumble now, but you also tripped back there. Fix both to become champions!" BPTT deals with time – it's like looking at the whole race, not just a single moment.

**3. Unrolled Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):**
Picture your robot friends as a synchronized dance troupe. In a regular dance, they perform moves one after another. But if you unroll the dance, it's like watching each move in a sequence. Unrolling helps the coach (that's you!) see every step clearly. In an RNN, unrolling is like stretching out time, making it easier to understand and correct mistakes.

**4. Training Sequence of Neural Networks:**
Okay, now think of training your robot friends as a series of rehearsals. Each rehearsal (or time step) is like a practice round of the dance. BPTT guides them from the last rehearsal back to the first, making sure they get every move right. It's like perfecting the dance by fixing mistakes in each step until they nail the entire routine.

**5. Computational Expense:**
Finally, imagine your robots are training for a super-long dance routine. BPTT, while powerful, can be a bit exhausting for the coach and the robots because it involves going through every step, making corrections, and doing it over and over. It's like practising a marathon dance – it takes time and energy, especially when there are many steps (or time steps) to go through.

So, in robot training terms, BPTT is like the master plan to make sure your robot friends learn from every step they take, even if it's a little tiring when there are lots of steps in the routine.



## Problems caused by RNN

Imagine you have a team of tiny robots learning to dance, and they face two tricky challenges – Exploding Gradients and Vanishing Gradients.


**1. Exploding Gradients:**
Picture this: your dancing robots get overly excited and assign too much importance to some moves. It's like one robot shouting, "This spin is the MOST important thing ever!" The problem is, that when they get too enthusiastic, the learning process goes a bit haywire. Luckily, you can solve this by telling the robots to calm down a bit, like saying, "Hey, don't make that spin TOO important," and things get back on track.

**2. Vanishing Gradients:**
Now, imagine your robots are a bit shy. When they're trying to learn gentle moves, the importance they assign becomes so tiny that it's like saying, "This step is not important at all." But if a move is crucial for the dance, and the robots think it's not important, the whole routine gets messed up. This was a big issue in the past, like when the robots were stuck in the 1990s dance moves. Luckily, two brilliant dance choreographers (Sepp Hochreiter and Juergen Schmidhuber) came up with a concept called LSTM. It's like giving the shy robots a boost of confidence – they now remember important steps from the past, ensuring the dance routine is smooth and well-learned.

In simple terms, Exploding Gradients are when your robots get too hyped up, and Vanishing Gradients are when they become too shy. Fixing exploding gradients is like telling them to chill a bit, and solving vanishing gradients is like boosting their confidence with a smart memory trick called LSTM. Now, your robot dance team can gracefully learn and perform without stumbling!
